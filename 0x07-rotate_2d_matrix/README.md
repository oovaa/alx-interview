# Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an n x n 2D matrix, the task is to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation should be done in-place, meaning the original matrix should be modified.

## Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    pass
```

## Constraints

- The matrix will have 2 dimensions.
- The matrix will not be empty.
